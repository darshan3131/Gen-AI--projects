5. Follow steps 6 to 9 above using the terminal in the codespace. Instead of step 9 you can also directly create a PR through codespace by going to the **Source Control view** in **Activity Bar**.
  


## Alternatively, using GitHub Desktop: 
1. Open GitHub Desktop and log in to your GitHub account.

2. Make sure you are on the "Current Repository" view. If not, go to "File" and select "Add Local Repository" to add your repository.

3. In the "Current Repository" view, ensure you are on the branch that you want to submit a pull request for. If you're not on the correct branch, use the "Branch" menu to switch to the correct branch.

4. Once you're on the correct branch, make your changes and commit them to the branch. You can do this by clicking the "+" button in the upper-left corner of the GitHub Desktop window, making your changes, and then entering a commit message.

5. After you've made your changes and committed them, click the "Push origin" button in the top-right corner of the GitHub Desktop window. This will push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub.

6. Now, go to the GitHub website, navigate to your fork of the repository, and you should see a button to "Compare & pull request" between your fork and the original repository, click on it.

7. On the pull request page, you can review your changes and add any additional information, such as a title and a description, that you want to include with your pull request.

8. Once you're satisfied with your pull request, click the "Create pull request" button to submit it.

**Note:** In order to create a pull request, you must have a fork of the original repository in your GitHub account and you must have made the changes in that forked repository.
